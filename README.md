# Image-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow. The CIFAR-10 dataset is utilized, and the script covers data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, predictions, and evaluation.

## Introduction

This project focuses on image classification using a CNN. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The CNN is trained to classify these images into their respective categories.

## Libraries and Dependencies

```python
import numpy as np 
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt 
import os 
```
